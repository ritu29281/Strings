Given a binary string s. Perform r iterations on string s, where in each iteration 0 becomes 01 and 1 becomes 10.
Find the nth character (considering 0 based indexing) of the string after performing these r iterations 

Input:
s = "1100"
r = 2
n = 3
Output:
1
Explanation: 
After 1st iteration s becomes "10100101".
After 2nd iteration s becomes "1001100101100110".
Now, we can clearly see that the character at 3rd index is 1, and so the output.

 char nthCharacter(string s, int r, int n) {
       while(r--){
           string s1="";
           for(auto i:s){
           if(i=='1'){
               s1+="10";
           }else{
               s1+="01";
           }
           if(s1.size()>n) break;
        }
        s=s1;
       }
       return s[n];
    }
